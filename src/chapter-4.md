Surround yourself with positivity by spending time with people who uplift and encourage you. Fill your environment with things that bring you joy and inspire you. This shift towards positivity helps shape your mindset and promotes a positive outlook on life.

3. **Focus on Solutions, not Problems**: When faced with a challenge, it's easy to get stuck on the problem. However, focusing on solutions instead of problems promotes a positive mindset.
