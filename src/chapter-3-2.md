Negative thought patterns are habitual ways of thinking that can lead to negative emotions and behaviors. Common negative thought patterns include:

1. **Identify the Negative Thought**: Start by identifying the negative thought that is causing negative emotions. Write it down to get a clear understanding of what you're dealing with.

2. **Question Your Thoughts**: Ask yourself if the negative thought is true, and look for evidence to support or refute it. Often, negative thoughts are irrational and not supported by facts.

3. **Reframe the Negative Thought**: Reframe the negative thought into a positive one. For example, instead of "I'm not good enough," reframe it as "I am capable of achieving my goals."

4. **Practice Gratitude**: Practice gratitude by focusing on the positives in your life. This technique helps shift focus from negativity to positivity.

5. **Visualize Success**: Visualize yourself succeeding in achieving your goals. This visualization promotes optimism and a positive outlook on life.
